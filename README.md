## Prompt for RAG 

```
Summarize the following transcript in a **highly structured and information-dense manner**, ensuring all key points, discussions, and conclusions are captured with precision. Attribute contributions to specific participants where possible, preserving critical phrasing, questions, and terminology.

Omit only **irrelevant or redundant sections**, but **retain all contextually significant details** to ensure optimal retrieval in a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**.

#### **Output format:**
The summary must follow this structured format:

**1. Introduction**  
- Briefly describe the purpose of the discussion, participants, and key topics.  

**2. Key Discussions**  
- Organize content into **clear subtopics with headers**.  
- Include **specific arguments, counterpoints, and supporting evidence**.  
- Maintain original wording for key phrases, quotes, and **questions asked**.  
- Use **short, concise bullet points** for improved tokenization.  

**3. Decisions & Action Items**  
- Explicitly state **decisions made**, next steps, and assigned responsibilities.  

**4. Key Insights & Context**  
- Capture any **background knowledge, definitions, or external references** that add useful context.  

### **Additional Instructions for RAG Optimization:**
- **Avoid unnecessary abstraction**—prioritize **factual, structured, and well-segmented content** for efficient retrieval.  
- **Ensure the summary retains specific terminology and wording** that might match user queries in a retrieval system.  
- **Do not remove valuable details**, even if they seem secondary; a future query may require them.
